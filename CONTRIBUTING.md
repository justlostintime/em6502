**How to contribute**
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in the Dicussion Board. We want you working on things you're excited about.

**Here are some important resources:**

See the [Gambas3 Wiki](https://gambaswiki.org/wiki) for Developers is tells you what the tools are for development.

Checkout the [em6502 wiki](https://github.com/justlostintime/em6502/wiki) for day to day updates and documentation.

Disscusion: Find us in the [Dicussion Board](https://github.com/justlostintime/em6502/discussions/3) We're usually there during business hours.

**Testing**
We have a number of works in progress features. Please write Gambas Test examples
for new code you create. See the Gambas wiki unit test explanation for examples and guidance.

**Submitting changes**
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to em6502 with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). When you send a pull request,
we will love you forever if you include Gambas Unit test examples. 
We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your 
commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
> 
**Coding conventions**
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)

We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. 
It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride 
as smooth as possible.

Thanks, JustLostInTime EM6502 developer.
