Remarks of the creator of this document:

In the original document, the text has been displayed in two columns using a
very small font. This resulted in more then 80 characters in every line. So I
decided to place the columns under each other. As I already violated the layout
in this way, I decided for another violation: to use the complete line to
display text.

Instead of:

  Since the 6502 is doing all segment decode and multi-
  plex, it is possible to display data other than hex on a
  7-segment readout. A pseudo alphabet has been devel-
  oped and is displayed in the 7-segment display of the
  KIM in a scrolling manner.

IMHO no information is lost and it makes it more readable. If there is a
perfectionist amongst you, I do have the source of this document in WP 5.1
format wich should it make more easy to convert it to the original layout.


The document contains some schematics. I used the ASCII characterset to draw
lines etc. So they may look weird. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. There 
exists one with the IBM-characterset and is as so only (???) readable with
a text-editor under DOS.

KIM HINTS

Since you and your KIM-1 are relative strangers, we'd like to help you get
better acquainted. The material in this pamphlet will answer questions that are
frequently asked by a new KIM-1 user.



------------------ ANSWERS TO POPULAR KIM SYSTEM QUESTIONS ---------------------


1.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO OUTPUT DIGITS OTHER THAN HEX TO THE 6 OUTPUT LED'S?

  Since the 6502 is doing all segment decode and multiplex, it is possible to
  display data other than hex on a 7-segment readout. A pseudo alphabet has
  been developed and is displayed in the 7-segment display of the KIM in a
  scrolling manner.


2.  WHEN HANDLING THE BOARD, WOULD THE STATIC HAZARD BE RELIEVED IF ALL EDGE
CONNECTORS WERE SHORTED TOGETHER?

  The static problems are not as serious once the devices are installed in the
  P.C. board. Just be sure to use grounded tools and to discharge yourself to
  ground before touching KIM or the connected circuits.


3.  WHAT TYPE OF LED READOUT IS USED ON KIM-1 FOR U18, etc? GENERAL COMMON ANODE
OR CATHODE?

  Use MAN-72 Type displays, available from many manufacturers. General common
  anodes should work, although you may find intensity differences between them.


4.  WHERE CAN I GETMORE 44-PIN EDGECONNECTORS FOR KIM?

  The connector is a standard part - you can order a Vector No. R644 from most
  electronic supply houses. The connector is also carried by most Radio Shack
  stores as Part No.276-548.


5.  ARE THERE ANY INTERFACES OR PROM PROGRAMMERS AVAILABLE WITH KIM TO PROGRAM
EPROMs OR TO DUPLICATE PROMs?

  No, not yet.


6.  IS THERE AN I/O EXPANSION BOARD AVAILABLE?

  Not yet - - . soon, we hope.


7.  IS THERE A BOARD AVAILABLE TO MAKE USE OF MEMORY ADDRESSES 0400-13FF?

  Check the "Kilobaud" article (issue #4, April 1, 1977, page 741 entitled "KIM
  Memory Expansion."


8.  HOW DO I SET UP MY KIM FOR AUDIO CASSETTE RECORDING AND PLAYBACK?

  A number of KIM-1 customers have reported difficulty in achieving correct
  results for the sample problem shown in Sec. 2.4 of the KIM-1 User Manual. In
  addition, some customers have experienced problems in recording or playback
  of audio cassettes. (Sec. 2.5 of the KIM-1 User Manual). In all cases, the
  problems have been traced to a single cause: the inadvertent setting of the
  DECIMAL MODE.

  The 6502 Microprocessor Array used in the KIM-1 system is capable of
  operating in either binary or decimal arithmetic mode. The programmer must be
  certain that the mode is selected correctly for the program to be executed.
  Since the system may be in either mode after initial power-on, a specific
  action is required to insure the selection of the correct mode. Specifically,
  the results predicted for the sample problem (Sec. 2.4) are based on the
  assumption that the system is operating in the binary arithmetic mode. To
  insure that this is the case, insert the following key sequence prior to the
  key operations shown at the bottom of Page 11 of the KIM-i User Manual.

     [AD]
     [0]  [0] [F] [1]
     [DA] [0] [0]

  This sequence resets the decimal mode flag in the Status Register prior to
  the execution of the sample program.

  The same key sequence may be inserted prior to the key operations shown on
  pages 14 and i5 for audio cassette recording and playback. These operations
  will not be performed correctly if the decimal mode is in effect. 

  In general, whenever a program is to be executed in response to the [GO] key,
  the programmer should insure that the correct arithmetic mode has been set in
  the status register (OOF1) prior to program execution.


9.  HOW DO I SOLVE AUDIO CASSETTE INTERFACE PROBLEMS?

  A. Insure that memory location OOF1 has been set to a value of OO before
  recording or playing back the tape. This is the source of 90% of all cassette
  problems.

  B. Mis-adjustment of the variable resistor (VR 11) in the cassette circuitry
  is almost never a problem. Any setting near the center of its rotation will
  work fine.


                                     1

================================================================================

  C. Make sure that +12V is connected during playback. NOTE: +12v is not
  required for recording, so a lack of +12V will result in good recording but
  no playback.

  D. If the display frequently relights showing FFFF, the fault is probably in
  the tape unit itself - not the KIM. Using poor quality cassettes is usually
  to blame. Some cassette recorders have such poor power filtering circuits
  that they will work fine on batteries, but will not work with an AC adapter
  because of hum induced during record or playback. Tapes should always be
  rewound before removal from the machine, as a fingererprint on the tape will
  result in errors on playback.

  E. Make sure that only a single ground line is run fromt the KIM ground to
  the barrel of the microphone input ofthe cassette recorder. Leave the barrel
  of the ear phone Output ungrounded. The shield around the line to the
  earphone should be attached to ground on KIM.

  F. Problems of playing a tape recorded on one KIM system back on another
  system or a different cassette player can usually be solved by adjusting the
  head adjustment screw on the new cassette recorder. Play back a cassette
  recorded on the old deck on the new machine and adlust the head screw on the
  new machine for maximum volume. This adjustment is especially critical when
  using the SuperTape program.


10. HOW DO I SOLVE TELETYPE PROBLEMS?

  A. The most common problem is that the system does not respond to a
  reset-rubout sequence with a model 33 Teletype. This can be fixed by removing
  the wire connected to pin R on the KIM application connector, connecting a
  470 ohm resistor to that wire, and connecting the other end of the resistor
  to the +12V supply at pin N.

  D. Other common sources of Teletype problems are a short circuit in C5 or a
  burned-out Q7. Signal tracing with a 'scope should reveal these problems.


11. HOW DO I SOLVE PAPER TAPE PROBLEMS?


  A. KIM-1's having a date code in 1975 on the 6502 will not read paper tape
  correctly. These CPU's will be replaced by MOS without charge. Tom Pittman's
  TINY BASIC will not work on these machines either. The problem occurs because
  early versions of the processor did not set the zero flag correctly on TXA,
  TYA, TAX, or TAY instructions.

  B. When using a Texas Instruments Silent 700 data terminal equipped with
  digital cassettes or other highspeed paper tape devices, a Q (paper tape
  dump) may be performed at any speed acceptable to the data terminal, but
  playback (through the L command) must be at 10 cps.


12. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT OTHER PROBLEMS?

  A. If the RESET on KIM causes only a single digit or segment to light on the
  display, the KIM must be returned for repair.

  B. When in doubt, check all power supply voltages on the KIM board, not at
  the power supply terminals.

  C. When software works strangely or erratically, decimal/binary mode problems
  may be involved.

  D. There is an error in the KIM Resident Assembler manual regarding the
  addresses for the symbol table vectors. The vector locations are DF, E0, E1,
  E2. The text is incorrect, the example is correct.

  E. Problems with KIM-2/3's which fail the memory test program can almost
  always be traced to excessiv cable length between the KIM-1 and the KIM-2/3.
  Any cable should be 6" in length or less.


13. WHAT ARE THE KIM SYSTEM POWER SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS?

  KIM 1 - Microcomputer Board:

  Recommended:   1.2A   +5V ~5%
                 100 mA +12V ~5%

  The actual power measured ranges 700 mA to 1A at +5V and the schematic
  indicating 3A at transformer is incorrect.


  KIM 3A-8K RAM Memory Board:

  Recommended:   +5V, 3A
  Average consumption calculated is about 2.4A. Board has +5V regulator
  accepting unregulated +8 to +1OV DC.


  KIM 4 - Mother Board:

  Consumption about 2OOmA. Board has +5V regulator accepting unregulated +8 to
  +1OV DC and +12V regulator accepting unregulated +15V DC to support both KIM1
  and KIM 4. KIM 4 has 6 slots for memory expansion with KIM2 and KIM3 and
  hence a total power supply requirement is a cumulative value dependent on
  KIM-System configuration.


14. WHAT SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE?

  The following software is available for use with the KIM-1 and/or other
  6502-based systems:

INTERVAL TIMER OPERATION

1.  OPERATION
a.  Loading the timer
The divide rate and interrupt option enable/disable are programmed by decoding
the least significant address bits.


                                     3

================================================================================

The starting count for the timer is determined by the value written to that
address.


 Writing      Sets Divide           Interrupt
to Address    Ratio To              Capability Is

  1704              1               Disabled
  1705              8               Disabled
  1706             64               Disabled
  1707           1024               Disabled
  170C              1               Enabled
  170D              8               Enabled
  170E             64               Enabled
  170F           1024               Enabled


b. Determining the timer status

After timing has begun, reading address location 1707 will provide the timer
status. If the counter has passed the count of zero, bit 7 will be set to 1,
otherwise, bit 7 (and all other bits in location 1707) will be zero. This allows
a program to "watch" location 1707 and determine when the timer has timed out.
Note that reading 1707 provides an entirely different function from writing the
same location.


c. Reading the count in the timer

If the timer has not counted past zero, reading location 1706 will provide the
current timer count and disable the interrupt option; reading location 170E will
provide the current timer count and enable the interrupt option. Thus first, the
interrupt option can be changed while the timer is watching counting down. Note
that you read 1706 or 170E regardless of which location (1704-0F) was written to
start the timer.

If the timer has counted past zero, reading either memory location 1706 or 170E
will restore the divide ratio to its previously programmed value, disable the
interrupt option and leave the timer with its current count. 


d. Using the interrupt option

In order to use the interrupt option described above, line PB7 (application
connector, pin 15) should be connected to the either the IRQ (Expansion
Connector, pin 4) or NMI (Expansion Connector, pin 6) pin depending on the
desired interrupt function. PB7 should be programmed as an input line (its
normal state after a RESET).


  ------------------------ NOTE -------------------------
  |                                                     |
  | If the programmer desires to use PB7 as a nor-      |
  | mal I/O line, the programmer is responsible for     |
  | disabling the timer interrupt option (by writing    |
  | or reading address 1706) so that it does not        |
  | interfere with normal operation of PB7 Also,        |
  | PB7 was designed to be wire-ORed with other         |
  | possible interrupt sources; if this is not desired, |
  | a 5.1K resistor should be used as a pull-up         |
  | from PB7 to +5v. (The pull-up should NOT be         |
  | used if PB7 is connected to NMI or IRQ.)            |
  |                                                     |
  -------------------------------------------------------


2. CAPABILITIES

The KIM Interval Timer allows the user to specify a preset count and a clock
divide rate by writing to a memory location. As soon as the write occurs,
counting at the specified rate begins. The timer counts down at
the clock frequency divided by the divide rate. The current timer count may be
read at any time. At the user's option the timer may be programmed to generate
an interrupt when the counter counts down past zero. When a count of zero is
passed, the divide rate is automatically set to 1 and the counter con tinues to
count down at the clock rate starting at a count FF (-1 in two's complement
arithmetic). This allows the user to determine how many clock cycles have passed
since the timer reached a count of zero. Since the counter never stops,
continued counting down will reach 00 again then FF, and the count will
continue.


3.  INTERVAL TIMER AND KEYBOARD OPERATION

The following three programs show the use of the interval timer, keyboard and
seven segment displays in user programs.


The first program loads a value of 50 in the timer and waits for it to time out,
repeats the process and then increments the count in the display register (00FA
and 00FB) and calls the display subroutine SCANS. The process then repeats.

The second program performs the same function as the first but uses the timer to
provide interrupts, rather than watching the timer status register (1707). Thus
this program is constantly cycling through the display program SCANS except when
the timer generates an interrupt. When an interrupt occurs the interrupt service
routine (starting at location 010C) resets the timer, increments the display
register and returns to the display program. Note that the LED display is
brighter when using this program because most of the computer's time is spent
displaying rather than watching the timer.

The third example program demonstrates the use of the keyboard and display. Any
key depressed will appear in the rightmost digit of the display and will be
shifted to the left with each successive keyboard entry.

Notice that the SCANS routine not only displays the contents of 00F9, 00FA and
00FB but also returns with the Z flag set to 0 if a key is currently depressed.
The GETKEY routine is then called to determine which key has been depressed.
Since the SCANS subroutine takes several milliseconds, a call to this routine
can be used to "waste time" and let any key bounce stop.
